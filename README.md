#http://arush.me Source Code

This website is my portfolio website designed and implemented by me.
It is my first web project and includes a lot of experimentation.

##Current Implementation
Currently, the site is just a portfolio site, and thus is a static site. It uses JQuery to animate logos, but otherewise is purely HTML and CSS. It is hosted on an S3 bukkit and uses cloudfront as the DNS with a goDaddy name.

##Future Plans
Expand! Put in projects currently working on, and relevant experience.

##Contact
Any comments are welcome!

> The author would greatly appreciate it if the design of the site was **not copied**.
